          <div class="bibo:abstract">
            <p>A mathematical description of polyglutamated folate kinetics
    for human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7) has been formulated
    based upon experimental folate, methotrexate (MTX), purine, and
    pyrimidine pool sizes as well as reaction rate parameters
    obtained from intact MCF-7 cells and their enzyme isolates. The
    schema accounts for the interconversion of highly
    polyglutamated tetrahydrofolate, 5-methyl-FH4, 5-10-CH2FH4,
    dihydrofolate (FH2), 10-formyl-FH4 (FFH4), and 10-formyl-FH2
    (FFH2), as well as formation and transport of the MTX
    polyglutamates. Inhibition mechanisms have been chosen to
    reproduce all observed non-, un-, and pure competition
    inhibition patterns. Steady state folate concentrations and
    thymidylate and purine synthesis rates in drug-free intact
    cells were used to determine normal folate Vmax values. The
    resulting average-cell folate model, examined for its ability
    to predict folate pool behavior following exposure to 1 microM
    MTX over 21 h, agreed well with the experiment, including a
    relative preservation of the FFH4 and CH2FH4 pools. The results
    depend strongly on thymidylate synthase (TS) reaction
    mechanism, especially the assumption that MTX di- and
    triglutamates inhibit TS synthesis as greatly in the intact
    cell as they do with purified enzyme. The effects of cell cycle
    dependence of TS and dihydrofolate reductase activities were
    also examined by introducing G- to S-phase activity ratios of
    these enzymes into the model. For activity ratios down to at
    least 5%, cell population averaged folate pools were only
    slightly affected, while CH2FH4 pools in S-phase cells were
    reduced to as little as 10% of control values. Significantly,
    these folate pool dynamics were indicated to arise from both
    direct inhibition by MTX polyglutamates as well as inhibition
    by elevated levels of polyglutamated FH2 and FFH2.</p>
